"I was one of the lucky few to pick up one of these on Prime Day for just $160 which was an amazing price for such a decent TV.  Even at it's current price of $337 I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one if we had the need for one in the near future.This replaced one of the old Seiki 50"" 4K TV's that came out a decade ago and were by far the least expensive 4K TV's you could get at the time.  The main TV in my house is a 2019 75"" Vizio P-Series.  Probably the most telling thing I could say about this TV is that I used to avoid watching any movies or anything ""pretty"" that the visuals were right up there with the story because the old Seiki was not real great of picture quality.  I no longer worry about that however as the picture from this TV is very good for it's price.Pros:  - Consistent picture across inputs. I had change the picture settings switching from game to show on the Seiki which was horribly annoying.  - Good lighting with no major hotspot issues.  Not unexpected since it has full array local dimming.  - Contrary to some reviews stating otherwise I don't notice any significant motion blur.  Perhaps the Google version has this issue?  - It plays nice with standard and non-standard external devices:  - Works great with the Xbox One  - Surprisingly also works great with my Asus PN41 mini PC (no over/underscan issues)  - Sound is as expected for a thin LED TV that doesn't have room or depth for great speakersCons(?):  - Have had some issues with the wifi connectivity  - Likely a combination of wall mounting it on a wall which is brick on the exterior (the reflection of the wifi signals back towards the TV off the wall can really kill your signal)  - Unfortunately placement of the main router and sole satellite of my mesh Wifi system that doesn't allow any better placement than with a large brick fireplace and multiple walls directly between the router and the TV  - Not really a con as it's a pretty standard size and it's super cheap to get a longer one, but if you're wall mounting yours and wanting neat cable management you'll likely want to go ahead and order a longer power cable because the one this comes with is only ~6-8 feet long

"Had some Amazon card points and figured I'd use them to replace a 65"" Samsung plasma TV in my basement. Really love the Samsung plasma, the picture is smooth and clean. Got this Hisense Friday evening ans started setting it up. The TV is well assembled and looks high quality all around. This Hisense is the 75"" U6HF with FireTV. This TV is awesome! The picture is crisp and clean. The motion, even with sports is smooth and clear. The sound is great and fills my really large basement with ease. I had reservations about this TV, but decided to take a chance after reading many positive ratings. I'm happy to report that Hisense is really impressing me, it's a great TV, and a really good option when my kids hog my 86"" Samsung in my family room.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV. I did for my purposes--got a great monitor, much better movie viewing in my office when I so desire and it's not really hard to operate and handle many inputs. I'd buy another HISENSE as a main TV on their upper tier.If you're thinking you're going to get OLED or some competitors quality at a steal--not quite but very close .

"Deluxe Delivery and Unpacking was the best service. Guys were fast, efficiency, respectful of property. I didn't lift a finger and before I knew it the two fellows had the TV working and were leaving with the box and all the packing material. As to the TV it is big and beautiful. Setup was easy and straight forward. Colors are bright. Picture is sharp and clear. Pleased with purchase.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I got this for the price and the reviews I'd read. Given the price , it's a really good performer. I purchased this specifically to serve as a very large computer monitor. I don't have to wear readers while sitting at at 50 inch screen and I'm at a screen for hours. It works as such great with a modern computer. You get a giant desktop to boot--with lots of space to keep open windows etc. I tried gaming on it with an Alienware computer (not laptop)--2022 Alienware and it's been good. I'm not an avid gamer but the graphics are great. I used newer HDMI cables to insure good quality. I'd say it' would be fine with an Xbox or PS3 as well as a cheap but very respectable alternative to a stand alone monitor of this size. Professional gamers should go elsewhere for myriad reasons and simply would not choose a TV as a monitor but everyone else--you might be quite pleased given the price.I've read so much about it being an Amazon TV--true, that's the interface that's the main screen when you turn it on-- but it's as simple as pushing a few buttons, going to inputs and there's the computer as an input. I have the signal for the TV as an internet driven TV using a cable directly off my router but I did try it on WIFI (I have a very good WIFI system at home) and it was fine and generating high quality images.Yes when the screen goes to sleep, you must push the home screen button, toggle over to inputs to your computer input and wake your computer from sleep via keyboard and mouse-it's been fussy--I have to usually hit the keyboard a few times, jiggle the mouse but again we're talking 4 seconds and given the price I can live with the jiggle when that happens. Waking the computer first , then going to the inputs seems to be more reliable but this is no deal breaker by any means.I will say that the settings menus for the TV is confusing. You don't get global settings (where you it a settings button for the TV as a whole, for all things connected to the TV and apply to everything--much of your picture settings is dependent on what you are watching. So if you are watching a very high quality Netflix or Amazon Prime Show, the settings give you a broad range of options and you see the impact of those settings as you tamper for that programming. If I'm using it on my computer, I have to tweak those settings when the computer is up to insure the settings are what I want. If I am gaming (as an option) under the computer , I readjust for gaming. If I bring up any of the HD Youtube stuff for 4K--the picture is marvelous, that pristine wow picture you see on screens on display at a big box store.I do notice with scenes that are night , on Netflix or Prime, for some night scenes some issues with shadows or darkness (meaning you will see a kind of clouding abstract dark patch on the screen). You can adjust settings to get rid of this and lose some picture quality, sit further back etc. Given the price, I'd not sweat it.Other reviewers have mentioned 120hz--this is a 60hz machine (though it may do things up to 120HZ)---I've not scene specific settings that suddenly let you deal with or designate that the TV should generate 120hz. I'd welcome a post talking to that matter, be great to unlock all that but I fear on this model it's not there.Someone used the word Vivid in another post. The settings that pump out color on this machine are referred to as DYNAMIC, then there's natural, movie, standard, game PC--basically ignoring those labels--pick and choose what looks best for you and fiddle with the associated settings under those labels. There is also a custom setting for the very brave.Getting at settings is remote dependent, so that's where the action is, learn the remote. Not all remote features will work unless the content has that enabled. There's vague references to that on some of the main TV settings under the Fire settings menu on the main screen. Customer support won't tell you that and you may end up unnecessarily resetting your TV (per their directive) when in fact it's working fine.So I'd say this--if you want a cheap 4K QLED that will impress with many things, but not all, go for it with this 50 inch TV.

"I was one of the lucky few to pick up one of these on Prime Day for just $160 which was an amazing price for such a decent TV.  Even at it's current price of $337 I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another one if we had the need for one in the near future.This replaced one of the old Seiki 50"" 4K TV's that came out a decade ago and were by far the least expensive 4K TV's you could get at the time.  The main TV in my house is a 2019 75"" Vizio P-Series.  Probably the most telling thing I could say about this TV is that I used to avoid watching any movies or anything ""pretty"" that the visuals were right up there with the story because the old Seiki was not real great of picture quality.  I no longer worry about that however as the picture from this TV is very good for it's price.Pros:  - Consistent picture across inputs. I had change the picture settings switching from game to show on the Seiki which was horribly annoying.  - Good lighting with no major hotspot issues.  Not unexpected since it has full array local dimming.  - Contrary to some reviews stating otherwise I don't notice any significant motion blur.  Perhaps the Google version has this issue?  - It plays nice with standard and non-standard external devices:  - Works great with the Xbox One  - Surprisingly also works great with my Asus PN41 mini PC (no over/underscan issues)  - Sound is as expected for a thin LED TV that doesn't have room or depth for great speakersCons(?):  - Have had some issues with the wifi connectivity  - Likely a combination of wall mounting it on a wall which is brick on the exterior (the reflection of the wifi signals back towards the TV off the wall can really kill your signal)  - Unfortunately placement of the main router and sole satellite of my mesh Wifi system that doesn't allow any better placement than with a large brick fireplace and multiple walls directly between the router and the TV  - Not really a con as it's a pretty standard size and it's super cheap to get a longer one, but if you're wall mounting yours and wanting neat cable management you'll likely want to go ahead and order a longer power cable because the one this comes with is only ~6-8 feet long

Got this Hisense Friday evening ans started setting it up. The TV is well assembled and looks high quality all around. This Hisense is the 75"" U6HF with FireTV. This TV is awesome! The picture is crisp and clean. The motion, even with sports is smooth and clear. The sound is great and fills my really large basement with ease. I had reservations about this TV, but decided to take a chance after reading many positive ratings.
